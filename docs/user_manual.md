## Getting Started

### What is the RAG System?

Your RAG system is a **completely local, privacy-preserving** intelligent document analysis platform. It allows you to:

- Upload your documents and create a searchable knowledge base
- Ask natural language questions about your content
- Get accurate answers with source citations
- Keep all your data private on your own computer

### System Overview

The RAG system consists of three main components:

1. **Document Library** - Where you manage your uploaded documents
2. **Chat Interface** - Where you ask questions and get answers
3. **System Monitoring** - Real-time health and performance status

### Accessing the System

Once your system is running, open your web browser and go to:
**http://localhost:3000**

You'll see the main interface with:
- **Navigation sidebar** on the left with Chat, Documents, and system status
- **Main content area** in the center
- **System health indicators** showing connection status

3. **Select Files**: Choose your document files (supports: PDF, TXT, MD, DOCX, and more)
4. **Monitor Progress**: Watch the real-time upload and processing status
5. **Completion**: Documents appear in your library once processing is complete

#### Bulk Document Upload

1. **Select Multiple Files**: Use Ctrl/Cmd+click to select multiple files at once
2. **Drag and Drop**: Drag multiple files onto the upload area simultaneously
3. **Batch Processing**: The system processes all files in parallel for efficiency
4. **Progress Tracking**: Monitor individual file progress in the upload queue

#### Supported File Formats

| Format | Description | Notes |
|--------|-------------|-------|
| **PDF** | Portable Document Format | Full text extraction with intelligent processing |
| **TXT** | Plain text files | Direct processing, fastest upload |
| **MD** | Markdown files | Preserves formatting structure |
| **DOCX** | Microsoft Word documents | Text extraction with formatting awareness |
| **RTF** | Rich Text Format | Text with basic formatting |

### Managing Your Document Library

#### Viewing Documents

Your document library displays:
- **Document name** and original filename  
- **File size** and format type
- **Upload date** and processing status
- **Quick actions** (view details, delete)

#### Document Search and Filtering

1. **Search by Name**: Use the search box to find documents by filename
2. **Filter by Type**: Filter documents by file format (PDF, TXT, etc.)
3. **Sort Options**: Sort by name, date uploaded, or file size
4. **Quick Actions**: Hover over documents to see available actions

#### Document Details

Click on any document to view:
- **Full metadata** (size, format, processing details)
- **Content preview** (first few paragraphs)
- **Processing statistics** (chunks created, processing time)
- **Usage statistics** (how often referenced in queries)

#### Deleting Documents

**Single Document Deletion:**
1. Click the delete icon (üóëÔ∏è) next to any document
2. Confirm deletion in the popup dialog
3. Document is permanently removed from your knowledge base

**Bulk Document Deletion:**
1. Use checkboxes to select multiple documents
2. Click "Delete Selected" button
3. Confirm bulk deletion
4. All selected documents are removed at once

### Document Processing

#### How Processing Works

When you upload a document, the system:

1. **Text Extraction**: Extracts readable text from your file
2. **Smart Chunking**: Breaks content into meaningful segments (typically 400 tokens with 50-token overlap)
3. **Embedding Generation**: Creates mathematical representations for semantic search
4. **Index Creation**: Adds your content to the searchable knowledge base
5. **Quality Validation**: Ensures processing completed successfully

#### Processing Status Indicators

- ‚è≥ **Processing**: Document is being analyzed
- ‚úÖ **Complete**: Ready to use in chat queries
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning**: Processed with minor issues (still usable)
- ‚ùå **Error**: Processing failed (document not available for queries)

#### Troubleshooting Upload Issues

**Upload Fails or Stalls:**
- Check file size (recommend <50MB per file)
- Verify file isn't corrupted or password-protected
- Ensure sufficient disk space is available
- Try uploading one file at a time for troubleshooting

**Processing Errors:**
- PDF files: Ensure they contain extractable text (not just images)
- Password-protected files: Remove password protection before upload
- Corrupted files: Try re-downloading or recreating the document
- Large files: Break into smaller sections if needed

## Best Practices

### Document Organization

#### Effective Document Management

**File Naming:**
- Use descriptive, consistent filenames
- Include dates or versions when relevant
- Avoid special characters that might cause issues
- Example: "2024-Q3-Sales-Report.pdf" vs "report.pdf"

**Document Structure:**
- Upload documents with clear headings and structure
- Include table of contents in longer documents
- Use consistent formatting across similar document types
- Break very large documents into logical sections

**Regular Maintenance:**
- Periodically review and remove outdated documents
- Update documents when new versions become available
- Organize related documents for better cross-referencing
- Monitor storage usage and clean up unused files

#### Content Quality Tips

**Optimize for Search:**
- Ensure documents contain searchable text (not just images)
- Include key terms and concepts you'll likely search for
- Use consistent terminology across related documents
- Add metadata or summary sections to important documents

**Document Preparation:**
- Remove password protection before uploading
- Ensure text is clearly readable and well-formatted
- Include context that might not be obvious to future users
- Consider adding document summaries for quick reference

### Effective Querying

#### Question Strategies

**Start Broad, Then Narrow:**
1. Begin with general questions to understand available content
2. Follow up with specific questions based on initial results
3. Use information from responses to guide further inquiries

**Use Natural Language:**
- Write questions as you would ask a human expert
- Don't worry about using "search keywords" - full sentences work better
- Include context and background when helpful

**Be Patient with Complex Queries:**
- Allow time for the system to process comprehensive questions
- Complex questions may take longer but provide better results
- Consider breaking very complex questions into multiple simpler ones

#### Query Optimization

**Effective Question Patterns:**

**For Summaries:**
- "Summarize the key findings from [specific document/topic]"
- "What are the main points covered in [context]?"
- "Give me an overview of [topic] based on my documents"

**For Comparisons:**
- "Compare [A] and [B] in terms of [specific criteria]"
- "What are the differences between [concept 1] and [concept 2]?"
- "How do the results in [timeframe 1] compare to [timeframe 2]?"

**For Analysis:**
- "What patterns emerge from [data/information]?"
- "What are the implications of [finding/result]?"
- "What risks or opportunities are identified regarding [topic]?"

**For Specific Information:**
- "What does [document] say about [specific topic]?"
- "Find all mentions of [term/concept] in my documents"
- "What are the technical requirements for [system/process]?"

### System Optimization

#### Performance Best Practices

**Document Management:**
- Keep your document library organized - remove unused files
- Monitor system performance and adjust if response times slow
- Consider processing large documents during off-peak hours
- Use appropriate file formats (PDF for formatted documents, TXT for simple text)

**Query Optimization:**
- Adjust similarity threshold based on your needs (higher for precision, lower for recall)
- Use appropriate max chunks setting (more for comprehensive answers, fewer for speed)
- Monitor response times and adjust settings if queries become too slow

**System Maintenance:**
- Regularly check system health indicators
- Restart components if you notice performance degradation
- Monitor storage usage and clean up as needed
- Keep your system updated with the latest versions

#### Resource Management

**Storage Considerations:**
- Monitor disk space usage as you add documents
- Larger document libraries require more storage and processing power
- Consider archiving older documents if storage becomes limited
- Plan for approximately 2-3x original document size for processed data

**Memory and Performance:**
- Close unnecessary browser tabs when using the system
- Consider your system's RAM when setting max chunks (more chunks = more memory)
- Monitor system performance during large batch uploads
- Restart the browser if you notice memory issues during extended use
