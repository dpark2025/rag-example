## üìÑ Your First Document

### Step 1: Access Document Management

1. **Open the interface** at http://localhost:3000
2. **Check the system status** in the left sidebar:
   - Look for green indicators (üü¢) showing "System Online"
   - If you see red indicators, check that all services are running
3. **Click "Documents"** in the left sidebar

### Step 2: Upload a Test Document

**Choose a document to upload:**
- A PDF file (report, article, manual)
- A text file (.txt, .md)

**Upload process:**
1. **Click "Upload Documents"** button or drag-and-drop area
2. **Select your file** from your computer
3. **Watch the progress bar** as your document uploads
4. **Wait for processing** - you'll see status change from "Processing" to "Complete"

> **üí° Tip:** Start with a smaller document (under 10MB) for your first try.

### Step 3: Verify Upload Success

**Check your document appears in the library:**
- Document name is displayed correctly
- Status shows ‚úÖ "Complete" 
- File size and type are shown
- Upload timestamp is recent

**If upload failed:**
- Check file isn't password-protected

## üí¨ Your First Question

### Step 1: Navigate to Chat

1. **Click "Chat"** in the left sidebar
2. **You should see:**
   - Welcome message in the chat area
   - Input box at the bottom
   - Settings panel on the right (similarity threshold, max chunks)
   - System status indicators

### Step 2: Ask a Simple Question

**Start with a straightforward question about your document:**

**Good first questions:**
- "What is this document about?"
- "Summarize the main points"
- "What are the key topics covered?"
- "What is the document's purpose?"

**Type your question and click Send or press Enter.**

### Step 3: Understand the Response

**Watch for the response process:**
1. **Typing indicator** appears while processing
2. **Answer streams in** word by word
3. **Source badges** appear showing which document was referenced
4. **Response metrics** show processing time

**Response elements:**
- **Main answer** in the chat bubble
- **Source citation** as clickable badges (e.g., "üìÑ your-document.pdf")
- **Processing time** and performance info

### Step 4: Try a Follow-up Question

**Ask a more specific question based on the first response:**
- "Tell me more about [specific topic mentioned]"
- "What details are provided about [something from the first answer]?"
- "How does the document explain [specific concept]?"

## üí° Tips for Success

### Document Selection

**Best documents for learning:**
- Well-structured PDFs with clear text
- Documents you're familiar with (easier to verify answers)
- Medium-sized files (5-20 pages) for reasonable processing time
- Content-rich documents with facts and details

### Question Strategies

**Effective first questions:**
- Start broad: "What is this document about?"
- Get specific: "What does it say about [specific topic]?"
- Ask for structure: "What are the main sections?"
- Request summaries: "Summarize the key findings"

**Questions to avoid initially:**
- Very complex multi-part questions
- Questions requiring information not in your documents
- Questions that are too vague or general

### Building Your Knowledge Base

**Smart document organization:**
- Upload related documents together
- Use descriptive filenames
- Start with high-quality, well-formatted documents
- Gradually add more content as you learn the system
