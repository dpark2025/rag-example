# RAG Example Project Overview

## Project Purpose
This is a **production-ready, fully local RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system** with a comprehensive document management interface. It's an enterprise-grade system that runs completely offline, combining intelligent document processing with local LLM generation to create a powerful question-answering platform that processes documents without external API calls.

## Key Features
- **100% Local Processing**: All data stays on your infrastructure - zero external API calls
- **Complete Document Lifecycle**: Upload, process, manage, and delete documents
- **Modern UI**: Built with Reflex framework for responsive, real-time interactions
- **Production Monitoring**: Prometheus + Grafana stack with health checks
- **Container Orchestration**: Docker/Podman support with monitoring
- **Multi-Format Support**: Text files, PDFs, and various document formats

## Architecture Components
- **Reflex UI**: Complete document management + chat interface (Port 3000)
- **FastAPI Backend**: Full v1 API with document lifecycle endpoints (Port 8000)
- **ChromaDB**: Vector database for embeddings (Port 8002)
- **Ollama**: Local LLM runtime (Port 11434)
- **Monitoring Stack**: Prometheus (9090) + Grafana (3001)

## Current Status
**PRODUCTION READY** - Feature-complete system with full document lifecycle management, PDF processing, monitoring stack, and enterprise-grade capabilities.
