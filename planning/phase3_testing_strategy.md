## Executive Summary

This document outlines a comprehensive testing strategy for the RAG System's Phase 3 document management features and overall system quality assurance. The strategy implements a risk-based testing approach with 90%+ code coverage targets, comprehensive integration testing, and performance validation.

### Testing Objectives

1. **Quality First**: Prevent defects through comprehensive test coverage
2. **Risk-Based Testing**: Focus on highest-risk, highest-impact areas
3. **Performance Validation**: Ensure <30s upload times and <200ms API responses
4. **Accessibility Compliance**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance verification
5. **User Experience**: Validate complete workflows from user perspective

@pytest.fixture
def sample_text_document():
    return DocumentFixture(
        filename="sample.txt",
        content="Sample document content for testing RAG functionality.",
        size=1024,
        type="text/plain"
    )

@pytest.fixture  
def sample_pdf_document():
    return PDFDocumentFixture(
        filename="sample.pdf",
        pages=5,
        content="Multi-page PDF content with complex formatting.",
        size=50000,
        type="application/pdf"
    )

@pytest.fixture
def large_document():
    return DocumentFixture(
        filename="large.txt",
        content=generate_large_content(size_mb=10),
        size=10 * 1024 * 1024,
        type="text/plain"
    )
```

**Database Fixtures:**
```python
@pytest.fixture
def clean_chromadb():
    """Provide clean ChromaDB instance for each test."""
    client = chromadb.Client(Settings(
        persist_directory=":memory:",
        is_persistent=False
    ))
    yield client
    # Cleanup automatically handled by memory storage

@pytest.fixture
def rag_system_with_documents(clean_chromadb):
    """RAG system pre-loaded with test documents."""
    rag_system = LocalRAGSystem(chroma_client=clean_chromadb)
    # Load test documents
    rag_system.add_documents(get_test_documents())
    return rag_system
```

### Test Environment Management

**Environment Isolation:**
- Each test gets clean database state
- Temporary file handling for uploads
- Mock external services (Ollama LLM)
- Isolated network requests

**CI/CD Integration:**
- GitHub Actions workflow
- Automated test execution on PR
- Coverage reporting and gates
- Performance regression detection
