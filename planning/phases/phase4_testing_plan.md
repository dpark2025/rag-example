python main.py

# Optional: Start Reflex UI (in separate terminal)
cd reflex_app
reflex run
```

## Test Categories

### 1. PDF Processing Tests

#### 1.1 Basic PDF Upload
**Objective**: Verify PDF files can be uploaded and processed

**Test Steps**:
1. Create a simple PDF file (or use any existing PDF)
2. Upload via API: `POST /documents/upload` with `Content-Type: application/pdf`
3. Check processing status: `GET /processing/tasks/{task_id}`
4. Verify document appears in list: `GET /documents`

**Expected Results**:
- Upload returns 200 status
- Processing completes successfully (status: "completed")
- Document appears in document list with `file_type: "pdf"`
- Metadata includes PDF-specific fields (page_count, extraction_method, quality_score)

**Test Script**: Use `tests/unit/test_pdf_processing.py`

#### 1.2 PDF Text Extraction
**Objective**: Verify text is correctly extracted from PDFs

**Test Data**: Create PDFs with different characteristics:
- Simple text-only PDF
- PDF with tables
- PDF with images
- Complex layout PDF
- Scanned PDF (OCR not implemented, should gracefully fail)

**Test Steps**:
1. Upload each PDF type
2. Query for content that should exist in the PDFs
3. Verify extraction quality scores

**Expected Results**:
- Text-only PDFs: High quality scores (>0.7)
- Complex PDFs: Moderate quality scores (>0.4)
- Extraction method fallback works (tries PyMuPDF → pdfplumber → PyPDF2)

#### 1.3 PDF Metadata Extraction
**Objective**: Verify PDF metadata is correctly extracted

**Test Steps**:
1. Upload PDFs with known metadata (title, author, creation date)
2. Check document metadata via `GET /documents/{doc_id}`
3. Verify metadata fields are populated

**Expected Results**:
- PDF metadata correctly extracted and stored
- Fallback to filename when metadata unavailable

### 2. Document Intelligence Tests

#### 2.1 Document Type Classification
**Objective**: Test automatic document type detection

**Test Documents** (create these files):

Improving Document Retrieval Through Semantic Embeddings

Abstract
This paper presents a novel approach to document retrieval using semantic embeddings.

1. Introduction
Document retrieval has been a fundamental challenge [1]. Traditional keyword-based 
methods often fail to capture semantic relationships [2].

2. Methodology
We implemented a system using sentence transformers for embedding generation.

- `research_paper.txt` → `document_type: "research_paper"`
- `meeting_notes.txt` → `document_type: "meeting_notes"`
- `financial_report.txt` → `document_type: "financial_report"`

#### 2.2 Content Structure Analysis
**Objective**: Test document structure detection

**Test Steps**:
1. Upload documents with different structures (hierarchical, list-heavy, tabular)
2. Check `content_structure` field in processing results
3. Verify appropriate chunking parameters are suggested

**Expected Results**:
- Documents with headings → `"hierarchical"`
- Documents with many bullet points → `"list_heavy"`
- Documents with tables → `"tabular"`
- Plain text → `"linear"`

**Test Steps**:
1. Upload documents of different types
2. Check `suggested_chunk_size` and `suggested_overlap` values
3. Query documents to verify chunking quality

**Expected Results**:
- Technical docs: Larger chunks (500-600 tokens)
- Legal docs: Very large chunks (800+ tokens)
- News articles: Smaller chunks (300 tokens)
- Meeting notes: Small-medium chunks (250 tokens)

### 3. Enhanced Query System Tests

#### 3.1 Basic Query Functionality
**Objective**: Verify query system works with new features

**Test Steps**:
1. Upload test documents
2. Query for specific information that exists in documents
3. Verify sources are returned with proper metadata

**Test Queries**:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/query \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"question": "How do I authenticate with the API?", "max_chunks": 3}'
```

**Expected Results**:
- Relevant sources returned
- Context tokens calculated correctly
- Document intelligence metadata included in source metadata

#### 3.2 Semantic Search Quality
**Objective**: Test semantic search with different document types

**Test Steps**:

2. Test queries with:
   - Exact keyword matches
   - Semantic similarity (synonyms)
   - Cross-document information

**Expected Results**:
- High-quality matches for exact terms
- Reasonable matches for semantic queries
- Proper ranking by relevance

#### 3.3 Similarity Threshold Testing
**Objective**: Verify similarity threshold is properly calibrated

**Test Steps**:
1. Upload a known test document
2. Query with various similarity levels
3. Test edge cases (very specific vs. very general queries)

**Expected Results**:
- Default threshold (0.6) returns relevant results
- Very specific queries find exact matches
- General queries return broader but relevant content

### 4. Processing Status & Monitoring Tests

#### 4.1 Processing Status Tracking
**Objective**: Test real-time processing status updates

**Test Steps**:
1. Upload a document
2. Immediately check processing status: `GET /processing/tasks/{task_id}`
3. Monitor progress updates
4. Verify completion status

**Expected Results**:
- Status progresses through: pending → in_progress → completed
- Progress percentage increases appropriately
- Final status includes processing notes and intelligence results

#### 4.2 Error Handling

**Test Cases**:
- Upload invalid PDF files
- Upload extremely large files
- Upload files with unsupported formats
- Network interruptions during processing

**Expected Results**:
- Graceful error handling
- Appropriate error messages
- Failed tasks marked as "failed" with error details
- System remains stable

### 5. Integration Tests

#### 5.1 End-to-End Workflow
**Objective**: Test complete document processing pipeline

**Test Steps**:
1. Upload multiple document types simultaneously
2. Monitor processing queue
3. Query across all uploaded documents
4. Verify cross-document search works

**Expected Results**:
- All documents processed successfully
- Queue management works correctly
- Cross-document queries return relevant results from multiple sources

#### 5.2 Performance Testing
**Objective**: Test system performance under load

**Test Steps**:
1. Upload 10+ documents of various types
2. Execute multiple concurrent queries
3. Monitor response times and resource usage

**Expected Results**:
- Upload processing completes within reasonable time (< 2 min per document)
- Query response time < 5 seconds
- System remains responsive under load

### 6. API Endpoint Tests

#### 6.1 New Endpoint Functionality
**Test all enhanced endpoints**:

```bash
# Health check with document intelligence
GET /health

# Enhanced document upload
POST /documents/upload (supports PDF + intelligence analysis)

# Processing status endpoints
GET /processing/status
GET /processing/tasks
GET /processing/tasks/{doc_id}
POST /processing/cleanup

# Enhanced document listing (with intelligence metadata)
GET /documents

# Query with intelligence-enhanced results
POST /query
```

#### 6.2 Backward Compatibility
**Objective**: Ensure existing functionality still works

**Test Steps**:
1. Test all Phase 3 functionality
2. Verify existing API contracts unchanged
3. Check that old documents still query correctly

**Expected Results**:
- All existing functionality preserved
- No breaking changes to API responses
- Legacy documents work with new query system

## Expected Test Outcomes

### Success Criteria
- **Document Upload**: 100% success rate for supported formats
- **PDF Processing**: >90% success rate with quality scores >0.4
- **Document Intelligence**: >80% correct document type classification
- **Query System**: >70% of semantic queries return relevant results
- **Processing Speed**: <2 minutes per document, <5 seconds per query
- **System Stability**: No crashes or memory leaks during testing

### Known Limitations
- **OCR**: Scanned PDFs require OCR (not implemented)
- **Complex Tables**: May not preserve table structure perfectly
- **Large Files**: Files >50MB may have performance issues
- **Semantic Matching**: Some queries may not find semantically similar content

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### PDF Processing Fails
1. Check file is valid PDF
2. Verify PDF libraries installed (`pip install PyPDF2 pdfplumber pymupdf`)
3. Check server logs for extraction errors

### Document Intelligence Not Working
1. Verify `document_intelligence.py` imported correctly
2. Check processing task logs for intelligence analysis errors
3. Ensure feature analysis completed successfully

### Queries Return No Results
1. Check similarity threshold (default: 0.6)
2. Verify documents were processed and stored
3. Test with very specific keyword queries first
4. Check Ollama is running for LLM responses (optional)

### Performance Issues
1. Monitor memory usage during bulk uploads
2. Check ChromaDB storage space
3. Restart services if memory leaks suspected
4. Consider processing documents in smaller batches

## Conclusion

This testing plan ensures comprehensive validation of all Phase 4 features. Regular execution of these tests will help maintain system quality and catch regressions early in development.

For automated testing in CI/CD pipelines, focus on the API endpoint tests and the automated test script. Manual testing is recommended for UI features and complex document scenarios.
