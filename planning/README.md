## Project Status

**Current Status**: âœ… **PRODUCTION READY** - Feature-complete system with all phases implemented

The RAG system has successfully completed all planned phases:
- âœ… Phase 1: Foundation Setup
- âœ… Phase 2: Chat Interface Implementation
- âœ… Phase 3: Document Management System
- âœ… Phase 4: PDF Processing & Document Intelligence
- âœ… Phase 5: Production Readiness & UX Polish

## Key Planning Principles

1. **Phase-Based Development**: Incremental feature delivery with clear milestones
2. **Quality Gates**: Comprehensive testing and validation at each phase
3. **Production Focus**: Enterprise-ready features with monitoring and security
4. **Local-First**: Complete offline operation without external dependencies
5. **Documentation-Driven**: Comprehensive planning and documentation for all features

## Related Documentation

- **Technical Documentation**: See `/docs/` directory for technical guides and API documentation
- **Architecture**: See `/docs/rag_system_architecture.md` for system architecture details
- **Testing**: See `/docs/guided_test.md` and `/docs/testing_guide.md` for testing procedures
- **User Guides**: See `/docs/user_manual.md` and `/docs/quick_start_tutorial.md` for user documentation

## Planning File Organization

All planning-related documents are organized in this directory structure:
- **Project Plans**: Strategic planning and roadmaps
- **Phase Documentation**: Phase-specific implementation and completion records
- **Release Management**: Release planning, validation, and deployment procedures
- **Testing Strategies**: Comprehensive testing plans and validation frameworks

This organization ensures clear separation between planning (this directory) and technical documentation (`/docs/` directory).
