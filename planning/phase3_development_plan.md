# Phase 3: Document Management System Development Plan

**Timeline:** Weeks 1-3 (3 weeks)  
**Started:** August 2, 2025  
**Status:** In Progress  

## 📋 Phase 3 Overview

Transform the RAG system from a chat-only interface to a complete document lifecycle management platform. Users will be able to upload, view, manage, and delete documents through an intuitive interface.

- [ ] Design upload modal/interface integration

#### Day 3-5: Backend Integration
- [ ] Create FastAPI document upload endpoints
- [ ] Implement file processing pipeline integration
- [ ] Add real-time upload status via WebSocket
- [ ] Error handling and user feedback

**Success Criteria:**
- Users can upload TXT files via drag-and-drop

#### Day 4-5: Document Operations
- [ ] Implement single document deletion
- [ ] Add bulk document selection and operations
- [ ] Create confirmation dialogs for destructive actions
- [ ] Add document sorting and pagination

**Success Criteria:**

- Metadata displayed clearly (upload date, size, chunks)

### Week 3: Processing Pipeline Enhancement
**Priority:** P1 (Release Enhancer)

#### Day 1-3: Status Tracking
- [ ] Implement document processing status states
- [ ] Add real-time processing progress updates
- [ ] Create processing queue management
- [ ] Add retry mechanisms for failed processing

#### Day 4-5: Error Recovery & Optimization
- [ ] Implement comprehensive error handling
- [ ] Add processing failure recovery options
- [ ] Optimize batch processing capabilities
- [ ] Performance monitoring and metrics

**Success Criteria:**
- Document processing status always visible to user
- Failed processing provides clear error messages
- Processing times meet performance targets (<30s)
- Batch operations work reliably

DELETE /api/v1/documents/{doc_id}   # Delete document
DELETE /api/v1/documents/bulk       # Bulk delete
GET    /api/v1/documents/{doc_id}/status  # Processing status
```

## 🔧 Implementation Strategy

### Week 1 Focus: Upload Interface
1. **Start Simple:** TXT file upload only
2. **Progressive Enhancement:** Add validation and feedback
3. **Integration:** Connect to existing RAG backend
4. **Testing:** Ensure upload→query workflow works

### Week 2 Focus: Document Management
1. **Core CRUD:** Create, read, delete operations
2. **User Experience:** Intuitive interface design
3. **Data Management:** Efficient document listing
4. **Safety:** Confirmation dialogs for destructive actions

### Week 3 Focus: Production Readiness
1. **Error Handling:** Comprehensive error recovery
2. **Performance:** Optimize processing pipeline
3. **Monitoring:** Add processing metrics
4. **Polish:** UI/UX improvements and edge cases

## 📊 Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- **Upload Success Rate:** >99% for valid files
- **Processing Time:** <30 seconds for typical documents
- **UI Response Time:** <200ms for all document operations
- **Error Recovery:** 95% of errors provide actionable feedback

### User Experience Metrics
- **Upload Workflow:** Complete upload→query in <60 seconds
- **Document Discovery:** Find documents in <10 seconds
- **Bulk Operations:** Delete multiple documents reliably
- **Error Understanding:** Clear error messages for failures

### Performance Targets
- **File Size Support:** Up to 10MB text files
- **Concurrent Uploads:** 3 simultaneous uploads
- **Document Count:** Support 1000+ documents efficiently
- **Search Performance:** <100ms for document filtering

## 🚨 Risk Assessment

### High Risk: File Upload Complexity
**Mitigation:** Start with simple TXT files, add validation incrementally

### Medium Risk: State Management Complexity
**Mitigation:** Clear separation between upload, processing, and display states

### Medium Risk: Backend Integration
**Mitigation:** Maintain compatibility with existing RAG system APIs

## 🔄 Quality Gates

### Week 1 Gate: Upload Functionality
- [ ] Users can successfully upload TXT files
- [ ] Upload progress visible and accurate
- [ ] Error handling for invalid files
- [ ] Integration with existing chat interface

### Week 2 Gate: Document Management
- [ ] All documents visible in management interface
- [ ] Search and filtering work correctly
- [ ] Document deletion removes from both UI and backend
- [ ] Confirmation dialogs prevent accidental deletion

### Week 3 Gate: Production Readiness
- [ ] All processing states clearly communicated
- [ ] Error recovery mechanisms functional
- [ ] Performance targets met
- [ ] No regression in existing functionality

## 📅 Daily Standup Items

**Questions to Track:**
1. Are we meeting upload success rate targets?
2. Is document processing time within 30-second goal?
3. Are there any blocking API integration issues?
4. Is the user experience intuitive for document management?
5. Are we maintaining performance with increased document counts?
