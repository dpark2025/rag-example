**Document Owner:** Kira Preston - Senior Technical Project Manager  
**Created:** August 4, 2025  
**Status:** Active  

## üìã Overview

This document defines the comprehensive version management strategy for the RAG System, including semantic versioning, branching strategy, release procedures, and maintenance workflows.

## üè∑Ô∏è Semantic Versioning Scheme

### Version Format: `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`

**Format**: `X.Y.Z` (e.g., `1.0.0`, `1.2.3`, `2.0.0`)

#### MAJOR Version (X.Y.Z ‚Üí X+1.0.0)
**Incremented for breaking changes that require user intervention**

**Triggers:**
- API breaking changes (endpoint removal, response format changes)
- Database schema changes requiring migration
- Configuration format changes requiring user action
- Architecture changes affecting deployment procedures
- Dependency changes requiring system updates

**Examples:**
- `1.5.2 ‚Üí 2.0.0`: Major UI overhaul requiring new configuration
- `2.3.1 ‚Üí 3.0.0`: API v2 removal, migration to v3 required

#### MINOR Version (X.Y.Z ‚Üí X.Y+1.0)
**Incremented for new features and enhancements**

**Triggers:**
- New document format support (Excel, PowerPoint)
- New API endpoints or functionality
- UI feature additions (dark mode, advanced search)
- Performance improvements and optimizations
- Security enhancements and hardening
- Backward-compatible dependency updates

**Examples:**
- `1.0.0 ‚Üí 1.1.0`: OCR support for image-based PDFs
- `1.2.0 ‚Üí 1.3.0`: Multi-language document processing

#### PATCH Version (X.Y.Z ‚Üí X.Y.Z+1)
**Incremented for bug fixes and maintenance**

**Triggers:**
- Bug fixes and stability improvements
- Security patches and vulnerability fixes
- Performance optimizations without new features
- Documentation updates and corrections
- Configuration adjustments and improvements
- Dependency security updates

**Examples:**
- `1.1.0 ‚Üí 1.1.1`: Fix document upload progress bar
- `1.2.3 ‚Üí 1.2.4`: Security patch for PDF processing

### Pre-Release Versions

#### Alpha Releases: `X.Y.Z-alpha.N`
- **Purpose**: Early development builds for internal testing
- **Stability**: Unstable, breaking changes expected
- **Usage**: Development and initial feature validation
- **Example**: `1.2.0-alpha.1`, `1.2.0-alpha.2`

#### Beta Releases: `X.Y.Z-beta.N`
- **Purpose**: Feature-complete builds for testing
- **Stability**: Feature-complete but may contain bugs
- **Usage**: User acceptance testing and feedback
- **Example**: `1.2.0-beta.1`, `1.2.0-beta.2`

#### Release Candidates: `X.Y.Z-rc.N`
- **Purpose**: Production-ready candidates for final validation
- **Stability**: Production-ready pending final validation
- **Usage**: Final testing before production release
- **Example**: `1.2.0-rc.1`, `1.2.0-rc.2`

## üåø Branching Strategy

### Git Flow Model

#### Main Branches

**`main` Branch**
- **Purpose**: Production-ready code
- **Protection**: Protected, requires PR approval
- **Deployment**: Automatically deployed to production
- **Merge Policy**: Only from `release/*` and `hotfix/*` branches
- **Tagging**: All release tags applied here

**`develop` Branch**
- **Purpose**: Integration branch for active development
- **Protection**: Protected, requires PR approval
- **Deployment**: Deployed to staging environment
- **Merge Policy**: Feature branches merge here first
- **Testing**: Continuous integration and automated testing

#### Supporting Branches

**Feature Branches: `feature/description`**
- **Purpose**: New feature development
- **Naming**: `feature/pdf-ocr-support`, `feature/dark-mode`
- **Lifecycle**: Created from `develop`, merged back to `develop`
- **Duration**: Short-lived (1-2 weeks maximum)
- **Testing**: Must pass all tests before merge

**Release Branches: `release/X.Y.Z`**
- **Purpose**: Prepare new production releases
- **Naming**: `release/1.2.0`, `release/2.0.0`
- **Lifecycle**: Created from `develop`, merged to `main` and `develop`
- **Activities**: Final testing, bug fixes, version preparation
- **Duration**: 1 week for MINOR/PATCH, 2 weeks for MAJOR

**Hotfix Branches: `hotfix/X.Y.Z`**
- **Purpose**: Critical production fixes
- **Naming**: `hotfix/1.1.1`, `hotfix/1.2.4`
- **Lifecycle**: Created from `main`, merged to `main` and `develop`
- **Priority**: Highest priority, can interrupt other work
- **Duration**: 24-48 hours maximum

### Branch Protection Rules

#### `main` Branch Protection
- Require pull request reviews (2 approvers)
- Require status checks to pass
- Require branches to be up to date
- Restrict push to administrators only
- Include administrators in restrictions

#### `develop` Branch Protection
- Require pull request reviews (1 approver)
- Require status checks to pass
- Allow merge commits, squash merging disabled
- Delete head branches after merge

## üöÄ Release Procedures

- **Examples**: `v1.0.0`, `v1.2.3`, `v2.0.0-beta.1`

### Tag Creation
```bash
# Lightweight tag (not recommended for releases)
git tag vX.Y.Z

# Annotated tag (recommended for releases)
git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m "Release version X.Y.Z"

# Tag with detailed message
git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m "Release version X.Y.Z

Major features:
- Feature A implementation
- Feature B enhancement
- Critical bug fixes

Breaking changes:
- API endpoint changes
- Configuration updates"
```

### Tag Management
```bash
# List all tags
git tag -l

# Show tag details
git show vX.Y.Z

# Push tags to remote
git push origin vX.Y.Z
git push origin --tags

# Delete tag (if needed)
git tag -d vX.Y.Z
git push origin --delete vX.Y.Z
```
