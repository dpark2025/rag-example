## Experiences

### Optional Dependencies Documentation Patterns (2025-07-30)
**Context**: External dependency documentation for developer onboarding

**Process Improvements**:
- **User Journey Mapping**: Start with specific personas and their complete workflows before writing
- **Pain Point Analysis**: Interview actual users to identify specific friction points with evidence
- **Quantitative Goals**: Establish measurable success criteria (setup time, error rates, support tickets)
- **Cross-Reference Strategy**: Plan linking between related topics early in information architecture

**What Worked Well**:
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Multi-file documentation ecosystem with cohesive information architecture
- **User-Centered Approach**: Focused on developer experience rather than just technical completeness
- **Performance Transparency**: Concrete comparison tables showing trade-offs between configurations
- **Integration Quality**: Seamlessly integrated with existing documentation without redundancy

**Areas for Improvement**:
- **Quantitative Performance Data**: Include actual benchmarks rather than qualitative comparisons
- **Visual Documentation**: Architecture diagrams and installation screenshots would enhance comprehension
- **Validation Automation**: Scripts to verify installation and configuration accuracy
- **Maintenance Strategy**: Clearer processes for keeping version compatibility current
