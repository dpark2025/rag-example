- **Credentials**: Stolen or weak authentication tokens
- **Network**: Man-in-the-middle attacks, traffic interception
- **Application**: Code vulnerabilities, logic flaws
- **Infrastructure**: Container or host compromise
- **Social Engineering**: Credential theft, insider threats

## Security Controls Implementation

### Authentication Controls
- **Multi-factor Authentication**: For administrative and sensitive operations
- **API Key Management**: Secure generation, storage, and rotation
- **Session Security**: Secure cookies, proper timeout, token validation

- **Service Authentication**: Mutual TLS, service-to-service authentication

### Authorization Controls
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Granular permission system
- **API Authorization**: Token-based access control with scopes
- **Resource Isolation**: Multi-tenant data separation
- **Audit Logging**: All access attempts and authorization decisions
- **Privilege Escalation Prevention**: Proper permission boundaries

### Data Protection Controls
- **Encryption at Rest**: Database encryption, file system encryption
- **Encryption in Transit**: TLS 1.3 for all communications
- **Key Management**: Secure key storage, rotation, and lifecycle
- **Data Classification**: Identify and protect sensitive data
